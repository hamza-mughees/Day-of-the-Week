# Day of the Week

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/hamza-mughees/Day-of-the-Week)](https://repl.it/github/hamza-mughees/Day-of-the-Week)

There is a much easier, buit-in way to get the day of the year for a given date, you have to be using Java 8, however. In order to use that, you must ```import java.time.LocalDate;```

The following is the same method as in the code, however, it has been written using built-in way of obtaining the day of the year:

```java
public static String getDay(int day, int month, int year) {
  LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month, day);
  return date.getDayOfYear().name();
}
```

Despite of this, I thought it would be fun to make my own method, which uses Zeller's rule to calculate the day of the week for any given date.

Zeller's rule states:

<p align="center"><img src="/tex/44c4890275d43cceea70b1b813896f46.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=369.00571949999994pt height=39.452455349999994pt/></p>

  * July → 5

  * When month is January or February, <img src="/tex/78ec2b7008296ce0561cf83393cb746d.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=14.06623184999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> of the previous year is considered

For some dates, there are cases where <img src="/tex/190083ef7a1625fbc75f243cffb9c96d.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.81741584999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> evaluates to a negative number. The rule provides a work-around for such a case as follows:

- Find the largest multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to <img src="/tex/190083ef7a1625fbc75f243cffb9c96d.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.81741584999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/>
- Subtract this multiple of 7, from <img src="/tex/190083ef7a1625fbc75f243cffb9c96d.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.81741584999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/>
- Let this value become the new <img src="/tex/190083ef7a1625fbc75f243cffb9c96d.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.81741584999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/>
